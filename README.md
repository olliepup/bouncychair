# Intro

Bouncy Chair is a web application written with Vue 3 and Vuex intended to simplify the use of "reactive avatars" with Discord voice chats and OBS. It has been tested with Streamlabs OBS and Discord StreamKit; while it may be possible to adapt its output to other configurations this usage is not supported.
